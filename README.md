# PRODIGY_DS_01
Task 1 at Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

## Problem Definiton:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

# Visualizing Data Distribution

This Jupyter Notebook explores various techniques for visualizing the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 1. Visualizing the Distribution of a Categorical Variable (e.g., Gender):
In this section, we create visualizations to understand the distribution of a categorical variable, 'Gender', in the dataset.
- **Bar Chart**: We create a bar chart to show the count of each gender category.

## 2. Visualizing the Distribution of a Continuous Variable (e.g., Age):
Here, we explore the distribution of a continuous variable, 'Age', using histogram and violin plot visualizations.
- **Histogram**: We create a histogram to visualize the frequency distribution of ages.

## 3. Separate Bar Charts for Different Categories of a Categorical Variable (Regions):
We create separate bar charts for different regions to visualize the distribution of genders within each region.

## 4. Separate Histograms for Different Subsets of Data (Single and Married):
Finally, we create separate histograms for individuals categorized as 'Single' and 'Married' to compare the distribution of ages within each group.
